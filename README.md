# 🌐 Multi-Platform Sentiment Analysis Using SQL & Python

This project dives into public sentiment across major social media platforms like **Twitter**, **Instagram**, and **Facebook**. 
Using advanced SQL techniques for data analysis and Python for clear visual storytelling, 
we explore how users from different countries engage emotionally with online content.

We focus on trends such as:
- Which countries react most strongly to certain sentiments
- Which sentiments are more likely to be **shared** or **retweeted**

## 🔍 Overview

- 💡 **SQL-powered sentiment analytics** from raw interaction data
- 📈 **Python visualizations** to make sense of cross-platform trends
- 🌍 **Country-based analysis** of emotional engagement
- 🔗 Connected via **SQLAlchemy** to bridge SQL and Python
- 📊 Visual insights on shareability and sentiment engagement

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **SQL** – For complex queries and sentiment extraction
- **SQLAlchemy** – To connect SQL data directly into Python
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – For cleaning, analysis, and plotting
- **Social Media Data** – Extracted from various platforms (pre-collected or anonymized)
